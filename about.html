<h1>About US</h1>
<p>Maryland is located in the Southeastern part of Liberia. It is bordered by Ivory Coast on the East, Grand Kru on the West and River Gee on the North, and the Atlantic Ocean on the South. Maryland County has an estimated population of 163,898 for 2017. The County is sub-divided into seven political districts but for operational purposes, it is further divided into four health districts. The health districts are: Harper, Karluway, Barrobo, and Pleebo/Sodoken. There are 24 functional health facilities (GOL and private) in the county, which includes 21 clinics, 2-health centers and 1 hospital that contains 86 beds.
  In Maryland County, poor health outcomes can be attributed to a combination of several factors including extreme poverty, hunger, poor infrastructure and long distances covered to access health care at existing facilities.  Malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea account for the majority of child mortality.  Obstructed labor, and long distances to access health care are responsible for many maternal and neonatal deaths as well.
